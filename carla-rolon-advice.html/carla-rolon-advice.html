                <h4>Take breaks!</h4>
                <p>While you are learning you get to points where it just gets confusing, or you have tried again and again and it just DOES NOT work. Don't be afriad to take a break... 10min, 15 min, an hour. Whatever you need to refresh and then come back to it.</p>
                <p>Creating this habit makes learning so much easier and it enforces the rule of coming back instead of sticking with it until you are so overwhelmed that you give up entirely.</p>

                <h4>Keep looking a few steps ahead</h4>
                <p>There are a lot of steps that you have to go through while you are on the journey of becoming a developer. To keep you motivated remind yourself of what is next. Example, I'm learning HTML right now after this comes CSS.</p>
                <p>This keeps you focused on your goals and helps you acknowledge your progress. So when you are feeling stagnant later on, you can think back to all the steps you have accomplished to get where you are now and remind yourself that soon what you are stuck at now will be just another step you accomplished!</p>
